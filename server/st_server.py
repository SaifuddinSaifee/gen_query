# CSV to SQL query generator+
    # This is a PAF project focussing on SQL query generation
    # Input in a CSV data sheet,
    # Ask the query, choose if you want an explanation or not, and get the query

# Features:
    # Input CSV
    # Type Table name
    # Structure of the data
    # Toggle for query explanation
    # Code snippet query 
    # Get the data from different data sources

        5. Structured Precision: The query must exhibit a high degree of structure and refinement, adhering to established SQL  conventions, use sequel query convection, such as new lines and uppercase for sql keywords.
        6. Data Absence Handling: If the data does not exist, clearly state this fact within the query. No explanations are to be provided.
